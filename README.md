# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I am a CS student and game tester willing to learn many concepts of Software Development.
## ðŸ’¬ If you have any suggestions on how my code or projects can be improved, feel free to reach me - I am open for constructive criticism.
### ðŸŒ± I'm currently working on 'Millionaires' quiz game, which connects with OpenAI Chat GPT to generate questions. 
Here are my current plans for the app:
* Improving the UI
* Code refactoring
* Implementation of Factory pattern for Chat Completion Service
* Unit testing
* Adding scoreboard
### ðŸ¤” 'LaunchDeck' is an diary-like app which stands as notepad, but it saves your input automatically, without need to save it manually. 
In the future I plan to improve it by implementing:
* Buttons for font-changing in the textbox 
* Fixing of asynchronous methods (currently you cannot type, while moving the window)
* Server with database where notes will be saved and then converting project to multi-platform app using .net MAUI
* Unit testing

### âœ… My other plans:
* Learning Selenium with C# to develop some basic skillset for automated testing.
* Developing an Alien Shooter-like game in Unity 3D.
* Some project with ASP.NET to learn the framework better.
